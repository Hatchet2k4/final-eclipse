Subject 7 Analysis
Med. Officer's Log
GT: 12.46.207

Volunteer subject 7 is 
responding relatively well to 
treatments.  No sign of 
abnormalities as of yet.  
There's no guarantee that any 
changes to the serum will be 
more effective once the 
subject is conscious.  All 
previous subjects have 
suffered varying degrees of 
skin discoloration and mild 
to severe amnesia after 
being mobile for more than 24
hours.  A more accurate 
analysis can be made after 
he is awakened.

Subject 5 Outbreak
Med. Officer's Log
GT: 13.26.207

Subject 5 was tranquilized 
today after injuring two 
staff members in an 
uncontrollable outburst in 
the cafeteria.  Her dosage 
has been doubled and she 
will not be awakened until 
we can pinpoint the cause of
the problem.  Hopefully we 
will have better luck with 
subject 6.

Subject 4 Mutation
Med. Officer's Log
GT: 13.31.207

I approached Subject 4's 
testing room this morning
only to find an 
unidentifiable creature.  The
subject had apparently 
mutated overnight with no 
warning whatsoever.  We're 
reviewing last night's video 
session to see when and how 
long it took.  Everyday the 
virus has become even less 
predictable than we first 
thought.

Lost Elevator Pass
Personal Log
GT: 10.43.207

I can't seem to find my 
elevator pass anywhere.  Last
place I remember having it 
was when I helped some staff 
members move a table from the 
cafeteria up to the storage 
room.  Jared told me to get a
new one, but why bother?  I 
always take the stairs.

Questionable Medicine
Med. Officer's Log
GT: 13.52.207

It's too early to tell if 
subject 7 has been fully 
cured or not.  Brain scans 
reveal extremely unusual 
activity while sedated.  He's 
also becoming more difficult 
to keep unconcious.  The 
senior staff has been hard 
at work on a new serum that 
will be tested on subject 8.
I've told them several times 
to try new medicine on old 
patients, but they won't for 
fear of killing them.  I 
figure they're going to die 
anyway, so why not try to 
save them?

Disturbed Soldier
Medical Officer's Log
GT: 09.35.207

One of the soldiers helped 
me escort subject 1 to Dr. 
Kelvin's lab today.  I could 
tell he thought it was a 
waste of time, having an 
impatient glare about him.  
His attitude changed when 
subject 1 growled at him, 
revealing her second set of 
teeth.  I couldn't help but 
laugh, though subject 1's 
failure is hardly amusing.

Infected Staff Member
Med. Assistant's Log
GT: 14.29.207

Subject 3 bit me yesterday 
when I tried to feed him.  
Took a small hunk clean out 
of my leg.  I haven't told 
anyone about it yet.  
However, it's starting to 
turn blue and really hard.
I almost don't feel any pain,
so I'm wondering what's going
to happen.  I will continue
to self-examine myself
secretly and log my progress.

GT: 14.32.207

Over the past few days I've 
experienced no physical 
change due to the bite.  
In fact, I'm wondering if 
things will get any worse.

GT: 14.33.207

I guess I underestimated 
the effects of the eclipse 
virus.  This morning I woke 
up and my entire leg was 
discolored and slightly 
deformed.  I've decided to 
inject myself with the latest
test serum and hope for the 
best.  If things get any 
worse I'm going to have to 
alert the senior staff.

GT: 14.34.207

If I didn't know any better,
I'd say the serum was having
the opposite effect.  Now 
roughly 50% of my body has 
been transformed.  I am 
changing at an unbelievable
rate.  I've got to page Dr.
Kelvin.
