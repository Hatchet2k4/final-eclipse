ika version 0.49
Time used: 2 weeks

This is a demo of Team Bitchfridge's compo entry, Final Eclipse. It is a 
combination of an FPS and dungeon crawler, inspired from System Shock 2. It 
has a fully working inventory and equip system, logs, enemies, and weapons. 
While we were unable to get as much actual game content as we would have 
liked, rest assured this game WILL be finished, as the engine is nearly
complete. 

Some of you who used to use Verge 2 a few years ago may remember a dungeon
crawler engine that I made. A few weeks before the compo started I had 
managed to start porting it, and it only took an hour to have the basic 
movement engine. When the compo was announced, I decided to finish the 
process and make a real game out of it. All graphics and music are original
and made just for this game, but most of the sound effects were taken from
various sources, including Soldat, Quake 2, and free online sources 
(http://www.stonewashed.net/sfx.html was where I started).

I hope you have as much fun playing this demo as I did making it! The full
game will have more items, weapons, log files with voice acting, and a deep,
interesting and slightly scary story. Hopefully you can all be patient for 
a few more short weeks. :)

Controls: 

Movement: Cursor keys to move, hold shift to strafe. If you prefer, there is 
also QWE, ASD at the top left of the keyboard, so you won't need to hold shift.
Fire: Ctrl
Reload: R
Tab: Fullscreen mode. Note that you can't use the mouse in this mode.
Pause: Esc
PDA: press 1, 2, 3, or 4, or M, T, O, L to switch PDA modes. Or you can just 
click the buttons. :)

Left click items to grab them, and left click again to put them down. 
Right click on items in your inventory to use them. If you have an item in the
left hand, you can press F to quickly use it as well. This only works if your
weapon is one handed (only takes two squares in your inventory).

Note: In this demo only Med Hypos and Log Recorders can be used.
